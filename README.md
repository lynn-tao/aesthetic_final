Hello and Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to grade my CS50 final project. Hope you enjoy :)

Launching Aesthetic.ly: Aesthetic.ly is a website built with Flask, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, and Python. It can be launched by first downloading and unzipping the folder with my source code that I submitted to Gradescope, and calling "flask run" in the VSCode terminal with app.py open.

STEP 0: Register New User
Upon launching Aesthetic.ly, the first page will be the Log In page. As you are a new user, navigate to the top right bar and click "Register". This will take you to the Register page, which will prompt you to enter a username, a password (password requirements must be met), and a password confirmation. Upon successful registration, return to the Log In page and enter your username and password. Upon successfully logging in, you'll be taken to the homepage, where you will see a hilarious meme and an invitation to take the Aesthetic.ly Quiz. (Right now, clicking any other tab besides Quiz will prompt you to take the quiz first!)

STEP 1: Take the Quiz
The Aesthetic.ly Quiz is a 10-question, carefully crafted and curated questionnaire designed to delve into your inner psyche. The first 5 questions are simple multiple choice select. Questions 6-8 are similar to Buzzfeed-style quiz questions, where you click an image as an answer. Question 9 is a slider question, where you click and drag the slider to an appropriate value. Question 10 is another multiple choice question based on an image prompt. After finishing these 10 questions, you must additionally enter your first and last name, and social media handle (optional). There is also an optional choice to provide feedback to me, which is private and won't be shared with anyone except the site creator (Lynn). Now, you can submit and get your results! You'll get your determined aesthetic with an accompanying image. Next, scroll down to follow an invitation to go shopping! Alternatively, you can also use the tabs along the top navbar to navigate.

STEP 2: Visiting the Shop
The Shop you see is personalized to your aesthetic! Upon entering the Shop, you'll see a short description blurb at the top, followed by a selection of 3 items that have been carefully examined, analyzed, and recommended to match your aesthetic. The item names are hyperlinked directly to the corresponding Amazon product, and the image of the item is also hyperlinked to the same address. Feel free to browse and shop to your heart's content, or use these product suggestions as a starting pad to really get into your aesthetic! For now, let's move over to the Music tab.

STEP 3: Collaborative Playlist
The playlist you see is personalized to your aesthetic! You'll see an embedded Spotify playlist with a few starter songs. You can start playing the playlist directly and vibe. Below the embedded playlist, you'll find a link that'll take you to Spotify, where you're a collaborator of this playlist and you can edit/add songs! Ah, the power of collective wisdom, bringing together the experiences of many fairies, or students, or victorian children. Let's head over to the Meet tab next.

STEP 4: Finding Friends
This is where you get to see everyone else that's been on Aesthetic.ly, and what Aesthetics were bestowed upon them! From the Users table, which displays first and last name, instagram handle, and aesthetic. Any names (including yourself, obviously) that are colored and bolded in green are people who share the same aesthetic as you! Feel free to head over the Instagram (linked in page) and start a conversation! Scroll below the Users table to see an Exploding Pie Chart (source: CanvaJS.com) for distributions of aesthetics among users.

STEP 5: Rinse and Repeat!
Not satisfied with your aesthetic? Want to try again? You can! Head back over to the Quiz tab at any time and take it again to get a new aesthetic! Note: As you are a logged in user, the only aesthetic that will be saved and displayed in the Meet tab will be your most recently determined aesthetic from the last time you took the quiz. What if I want to see all the aesthetics I've gotten, you ask? Head right over to the History tab!

STEP 6: Checking History
Tracking progress, growth, and character development is important! Once you've taken the quiz >1 times, head over to the history tab to see your own personal history of aesthetic results, along with the date and time you took them! Maybe one day you felt like an especially gifted kid, and another day you were a cottagecore fairy.

STEP 7: Share Aesthetic.ly!
Thanks for visiting! Share Aesthetic.ly with your friends to have a laugh!
